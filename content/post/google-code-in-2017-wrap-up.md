I know this post is coming a bit late because of my grade 11 exams. I wrote this post as soon as I got a break from studies.

This was the first time that I participated in Google Code-in. The main reason for this was that I never knew about this event. This time my friend told me about GCI 2017 and told about his experience in GCI 2016, this persuaded me to participate in GCI 2017.
